            <p>✽ In my Class X, I undertook an exciting project on "Hotel Management", showcasing my JAVA coding skills
                for the ICSE Exam [CISCE Board Class X Exam], which truly enhanced my understanding of the industry.</p>

            <p>✽ In my Class XII, I passionately developed an innovative project titled "Airline Ticket Booking System"
                Booking System" using PYTHON PROGRAMMING, which I presented for my AISSCE exam [CBSE Board Class XII
                Exam], showcasing my programming skills and creativity.</p>

            <p>✽ In my Class XII, I had the exciting opportunity to explore an investigatory project in Chemistry that
                focused on the fascinating process of "Blue Printing". We conducted this hands-on experiment in our
                school's Chemistry Lab, which truly enhanced my understanding and passion for the subject.</p>
