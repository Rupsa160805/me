                <p>Hello, my name is Rupsa Saha. I am a 1st year engineering student pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science
                    and Engineering (Robotics and Artificial Intelligence) under IEM New Town (UEM Kolkata). With a
                    passion for graphic design, web development, compelling visual narratives, or innovative solutions,
                    I pursued engineering. I believe in the power of collaboration and creativity, and I am committed to
                    bringing unique perspectives to every project. My goal is to not only meet but exceed client
                    expectations by combining strategic thinking with artistic vision. Apart from academics, I have a
                    keen interest in singing, dancing, painting, coding, and graphic designing. I have learnt singing
                    for 2 years, dancing for 6 years, and painting for 5 years. I have learnt Java in classes IX and X
                    (ICSE board) and Python in classes XI and XII (CBSE board). Not only that, I have learnt C and C++
                    too.</p>
